## 🌟 Theme: Viksit Bharat@2047
**Development towards various aspects of progress for the country, including economic growth, social progress, environmental sustainability, and good governance.**

### How This Project Aligns with the Theme:
- **Economic Growth:** Reducing food waste improves efficiency in food supply chains, benefiting businesses and communities.
- **Social Progress:** Ensures food reaches those in need, contributing to social welfare and reducing hunger.
- **Environmental Sustainability:** Prevents food wastage, minimizing the environmental impact of discarded food.
- **Good Governance:** Encourages responsible food distribution through technology-driven transparency and efficiency.

## ❓ The Problem
Every day, **tons of edible food** go to waste while **millions of people** struggle with hunger. Restaurants, grocery stores, and households often discard surplus food that could otherwise be redirected to those in need. The challenge lies in efficiently matching excess food donations with requests, minimizing waste, and ensuring timely redistribution before expiration.

## 💡 Our Solution
We present an **AI-powered Smart Food Waste Redistribution System** that **intelligently matches food donations with requests** based on:

✅ **Expiry Dates:** Prioritizing food items nearing expiration to prevent waste.  
✅ **Quantity Optimization:** Matching donations with requests while updating available stock.  
✅ **Real-Time Matching:** Live database updates ensure fast and efficient allocation.  
✅ **Instant Notifications:** Alerts for available matches to facilitate quick action.  

## 🔥 Features
🚀 **Real-time Donations & Requests:** Users can list and request food dynamically.  
🤓 **AI-Powered Matching:** Intelligent prioritization based on expiry and quantity.  
📢 **Smart Notifications:** Users get alerts when a food match is found.  
🎨 **Clean & Responsive UI:** Built using **React + Tailwind CSS** for a seamless experience.  
☁️ **Cloud Database:** Uses **Firebase Firestore** for real-time updates.
